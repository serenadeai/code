# Serenade

## Code with voice

Serenade is the fastest and easiest way to write code with natural speech. Give your hands a break without missing a beat.

Rather than memorizing keyboard shortcuts and language syntax, write code with natural voice commands like "add function hello" or "delete argument url". Use voice alongside typing and your existing workflow, or abandon your keyboard entirely.
