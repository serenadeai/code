# Serenade for Visual Studio Code

## Code with voice

Serenade is the fastest and easiest way to write code with natural speech. Give your hands a break without missing a beat.

Edit code, run terminal commands, and write documentation entirely with voice. Whether you have an injury or youâ€™re looking to prevent one, Serenade can help you be just as productive without lifting a finger. Use voice alongside your existing workflow, or abandon your keyboard entirely.
